Car Price Prediction Project
Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning regression model that predicts the selling price of a car based on various features such as brand, horsepower, mileage, model year, and other relevant attributes.

Steps Performed
Data Loading: Imported the CarPrice dataset containing various car features and their selling prices.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and corrected any data inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering:

Converted categorical variables (e.g., brand, fuel type, transmission) into numerical formats using encoding techniques.

Derived additional features such as car age from the model year.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the relationship between features and the price, checked feature distributions, and visualized correlations.

Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model generalization (commonly 80% train, 20% test).

Model Building: Trained regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict car prices.

Model Evaluation: Assessed performance using metrics like R² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Model Selection: Selected the best-performing model, typically Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, due to higher prediction accuracy.

Tools Used
Python 3.x

pandas — for data handling and preprocessing

scikit-learn — for machine learning modeling and evaluation

matplotlib and seaborn — for data visualization

numpy — for numerical operations

Outcome
The machine learning model achieved strong accuracy in predicting car prices, typically with R² scores exceeding 90% on the test dataset. The analysis highlighted key factors influencing car prices, such as brand reputation, car age, horsepower, fuel type, and mileage. This model can be used to provide reliable pricing estimates in car sales and valuation contexts.
